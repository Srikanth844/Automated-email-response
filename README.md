Automated Email Response System

Overview

This project is an automated email response system that utilizes OpenAI's GPT and Pinecone vector database to process, store, and generate replies to emails. The system continuously monitors incoming emails, generates responses based on past emails, and sends replies automatically.

Features

Email Monitoring: Checks for new unread emails periodically.

AI-Powered Responses: Uses OpenAI's GPT to generate context-aware replies.

Vector Storage: Stores email-response pairs in Pinecone for retrieval and similarity matching.

Automated Email Replies: Sends responses to received emails.

Scalability: Designed to handle multiple email interactions efficiently.

Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.7+

OpenAI API Key

Pinecone API Key

Gmail Account (IMAP/SMTP enabled)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/email-response-bot.git
cd email-response-bot

Install dependencies:

pip install pinecone-client openai email smtplib imaplib

Configuration

Update the following variables in the script:

EMAIL_ADDRESS = "your_email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your_email_password"
IMAP_SERVER = "imap.gmail.com"
SMTP_SERVER = "smtp.gmail.com"
SMTP_PORT = 587
PINECONE_API_KEY = "YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY"
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT = "YOUR_PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

How It Works

Email Retrieval:

The script connects to the Gmail IMAP server to fetch unread emails.

Extracts the subject, sender address, and body of the email.

Generating a Response:

The email content is embedded into a vector using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model.

The Pinecone database is queried for similar past responses.

A new response is generated based on previous similar emails.

Sending a Response:

The generated response is sent via SMTP to the original sender.

The email-response pair is stored in Pinecone for future retrieval.

Looping:

The script runs continuously, checking for new emails every 5 minutes.

Running the Script

To start the email monitoring system, run:

python email_bot.py

The script will continuously check for new emails and process them automatically.

Error Handling

If an error occurs while processing an email, the script waits for 1 minute before retrying.

All errors are logged to the console for debugging.

Security Considerations

Avoid Hardcoding Credentials: Use environment variables or a secure configuration file.

Use App Passwords: If using Gmail, generate an App Password instead of storing your actual password.

Data Privacy: Ensure sensitive email content is stored and accessed securely.

Future Enhancements

Support for multiple email providers.

Web-based dashboard for monitoring responses.

Enhanced response generation with fine-tuned GPT models.
